## But Why ?
- My system temperature frequently rises, and I’m still trying to determine the cause, for now, I just want to know whenever it exceeds 70°C so I can stop  those processes.
- also if my battery percent crosses 80 then it will notify me ,ubuntu system didnt had this feature so i wrote logic for it
